## üî• What is Streamlit?
Streamlit is an open-source Python library that makes it easy to build beautiful custom web-apps for machine learning and data science. To use it, just pip install streamlit , then import it, write a couple lines of code, and run your script with streamlit run [filename] <br/>

## üåà Introduction
In the present scenario due to Covid-19, there is no efficient face mask detection applications which are now in high demand for transportation means, densely populated areas, residential districts, large-scale manufacturers and other enterprises to ensure safety. Also, the absence of large datasets of __‚Äòwith_mask‚Äô__ images has made this task more cumbersome and challenging.

## üìÅ Dataset
The dataset used can be downloaded here - [Click to Download](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1XDte2DL2Mf_hw4NsmGst7QtYoU7sMBVG?usp=sharing)

This dataset consists of¬†__3835 images__¬†belonging to two classes:
*	__with_mask: 1916 images__
*	__without_mask: 1919 images__

The images used were real images of faces wearing masks. The images were collected from the following sources:

* __Bing Search API__ ([See Python script](https://github.com/Hott-J/Face-Mask-Detection/blob/master/search.py))
* __Kaggle datasets__ 
* __RMFD dataset__ ([See here](https://github.com/X-zhangyang/Real-World-Masked-Face-Dataset))

## üìå Prerequisites

All the dependencies and required libraries are included in the file <code>requirements.txt</code> [See here](https://github.com/Hott-J/Face-Mask-Detection/blob/master/requirements.txt) <br/>
Also, If you want to upload to the web, you need to download OpenH264. <br/> Link ‚úÖ (https://https://github.com/cisco/openh264)

After download openh264 dll, move it into python library.

## üöÄ How to Install
1. Clone the repo
```
$ git clone https://github.com/Hott-J/Face-Mask-Detection.git
```

2. Change your directory to the cloned repo and create a Python virtual environment named 'test'
```
$ mkvirtualenv test
```

3. Install the libraries required
```
$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt / pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## üí• How to Run

1. Go into the cloned project directory folder and type the following command:
```
$ python3 train_mask_detector.py --dataset dataset
```

2. To detect face masks in a static image, type the following command: 
```
$ python3 detect_mask_image.py --image images/pic1.jpeg
```

3. To detect face masks in a static video streams, type the following command:
```
$ python3 detect_mask_video.py 
```
